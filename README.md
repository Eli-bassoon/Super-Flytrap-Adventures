**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**

Here's how to get set up: [Setup](Setup.md)

## Code Style

I don't care that much about how you style your code but please adhere to the following conventions so people know what functions and variables are called.

* All classes and functions are in *PascalCase*
* All variables are in *camelCase*

## How 2 Github

**Pulling**

Before you do ANYTHING when working on the project, go to Github Desktop and pull new changes. This ensures you won't have as many merge conflicts.

**Commits**

A commit is a "checkpoint" where you can roll back to. You want to do this very often! Every time you fix a bug or implement a feature, immediately make a commit. However, don't make a commit when the game is in a broken state.

**Pushing**

Pushing uploads your changes to Github so anyone else can download them. You want to push whenever you are done with a work session and have something completed.

**Branches**

Branches let multiple people work on parallel instances of the project. They are a more advanced technique that you can use if you want but aren't necessary for this.

To avoid merge conflicts, I recommend committing directly to main most of the time.
